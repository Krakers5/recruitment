Have you ever wanted to know who is the strongest character in Star Wars Universe? Or which starship is ultimately the best? 

This app won't give you the direct answer to these questions, but if you play our game enough time and make neat notes, then you can figure it out by yourself! 

So, play, play again, play again, play again... 

## For devs

If you are dev and want to contribute to this project (some little changes in css would help it I guess...), I give you some tips:
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run cypress:open` to execute tests with browser dashboard OR `npm run cypress:run` to run tests in headless mode. The choice is yours!
